This is a canned development/network play infrastructure.

Basic idea: Use 'any' nodes, with fairly flexible configuration (Base
NetKit lab.conf + improvements detailed in netkit-improvements.txt),
to run within one Linux (that can itself be a VM if need be).

Contents:

doc/
 documentation about this setup (.. I wish ..)

topology/
 individual topology setups (one per sub directory)

node/
 templates for individual machines within topologies

util/
 utility scripts (e.g. the one used by 'make')

Old contents (symlinks)

case -> topology/
 individual topology setups (one per sub directory)

template -> node/
 templates for individual machines within topologies

Note: If experiencing too much I/O, following page may contain something of use:

http://docs.neo4j.org/chunked/stable/linux-performance-guide.html

Why? It seems that the default dirty page flushing behavior seems to
trigger anomalies with UML; or at least serious performance
degradations; at least in 3.2.0-55
